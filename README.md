# Cops and Robbers
In this project, a game has been developed and released based off of 
the pursuit-evasion problem in graphs. Specifically, a game of Cops and Robbers. 
This is a game set on a collection of nodes and edges where one group,
the cops, tries to catch the other, the robber. Each turn, the current team
moves across one edge. The robber wants to avoid the cops indefinitely as
the game will end once a cop and the robber are on the same node. The
final product is a game that is available to be played on any android device
that can reach the app store.

To do this, throughout the projectâ€™s lifecycle Unity has been used along
with C# to develop the front and back end of the app to currently offer
four levels and three difficulties to play. Each of these levels is based on a
different area and has a different style and graph layout, and each difficulty
is based on a different algorithm. The easy difficulty being a semi-random
walk around the graph and the two harder difficulties being based on a
slightly reworked Ant Colony Optimisation problem and algorithm.


At the end of this project, it was found that this game was not only a
clear representation of the pursuit-evasion problem but an enjoyable game
with re-playability that had its users eager to beat their own high scores and
hoping for further updates past this end point.
